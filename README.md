# Photography collaboration finder

A Rails app I'm creating during my web dev bootcamp at General Assembly in London.


## Purpose of the app

A service for analog photography enthusiasts on Flickr who are looking for a film swap partner anywhere in the world. The website will match users randomly with others so they can start collaborating.
